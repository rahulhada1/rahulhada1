- 👋 Hi everyone! I’m Rahul Hada, a seasoned data architect and data engineering leader with experience in designing, developing, and implementing distributed data solutions across on-prem, hybrid-cloud, and multi-cloud environments. My career has been rooted in building large-scale data lakes, data warehouses, and high-performance data pipelines, leveraging technologies like AWS, Snowflake, Kafka, and Spark, Hadoop eco-system using various data formats parquet, avro, json, xml etc.

I’ve had the opportunity to lead major projects, including developing Data Lake, building resilient data pipelines, low code data integrations, with observability and data governance best practices. I led optimizing cloud FinOps strategies for platforms like AWS and Snowflake in distributed data processing systems. My focus has always been on ensuring scalability, security, and cost-efficiency in data solutions while aligning with business needs and maintaining strong x-team collaboration.

In addition to my technical work, I’m passionate about knowledge sharing and contributing to the data and cloud community. I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals here, exchange ideas on data engineering, cloud architecture, and best practices for optimizing data workflows.
